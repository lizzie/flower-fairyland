## 故事

Since the days of ancient Rome the Calla Lily has been treasured as a flower of celebration. First cherished as a celebration of light, then a funeral flower, in today’s world the Calla Lily has become one of the most desired flowers brides use to celebrate their wedding day. It is associated with the lily as a symbol of purity and as such, these spectacular flowers are beginning to rival the rose in popularity for bridal bouquets. The Calla Lily, originally from the continent of Africa, is rich with history, and it is an elegant and colorful flower to enjoy on any occasion. Either as a cut flower, or in your garden, the Calla Lily’s bloom is a show-stopper, and its wide range of colors make it a special flower to enjoy.

The Calla Lily, Zantedeschia aethiopica, is often called the white or common arum lily. Although most often referred to as Calla “Lily,” the calla is not related to true lilies (genus Lilium) or to the lily family. The Calla is an arum and closely related to houseplants such as the philodendron, spathiphyllum, pothos, monstera, and caladium. In the wild, the Calla Lily prefers marshy areas. One of its closest relatives is the Skunk Cabbage, which also prefers a marsh environment, and is one of the most abundant and earliest-blooming northern wildflowers. Some varieties of Calla Lilies are fragrant, though thankfully, they do not share the pungent odor of the Skunk Cabbage!

Most Calla Lilies have colorful spathes, which is a modified leaf; what we think of as the flower petal. The central spike or spadix is the real flower! The stalks are like giant celery stalks and the leaves are heart-shaped and have a luscious, dark green color that may sometimes be speckled. The common Calla Lily usually spire to 3 feet and produce snowy white spathes 4 to 6 inches across with yellow centers. Other callas are generally somewhat smaller, varying from 1 to 2 feet in height. The small Calla Lilies are called Minis.

According to Martha Stewart’s Living, volume 2, The Calla Lily was the flower that the early Romans used to mark the passage of the winter solstice. The Romans planted the Calla Lily just inside the portal to their homes, timing it to bloom for winter solstice and giving the effect of bringing the light indoors during the darkest days of the year. The greater the display of Calla Lilies usually meant the wealthier the resident that lived there. The Romans valued them so much that they often decorated the edges of the bloom with filaments of gold. The Calla Lilies of Roman times were said to be much larger than today’s varieties, and often were as tall as seven feet!

Supposedly, the Calla Lily was named after Professor Giovanni Zantedeschi, 1773-1846, an Italian physician and botanist. The name aethiopica is thought to mean south of Egypt and Libya, though the word appears like it is related to Ethiopia in some manner. It is not know exactly when and how the Calla Lily was introduced to Europe, but it appeared in an illustrated account of the Royal Garden in Paris in 1664.

Over time, the Calla Lily became associated with the celebration of funerals. Most likely, because they bloomed profusely during the darkest time of the year, winter solstice. Katharien Hepburn’s famous whispered line, “The Calla lilies are in bloom again!” in Stage Door, was a subtle reference to the dying of the light. At Gallery Florist, our designers are often asked to create sympathy pieces with Calla Lilies, though the majority of the blooms we sell are for arrangements and wedding flowers. The Society of American Florists feels that Calla lilies “are on their way to becoming one of the top flowers, in terms of consumer demand.”
